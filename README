SystemInfo for Haiku - A system monitor for Haiku

	By Disreali
	Based on original by Brent "misza" Miszalski circa 2002

I found this app on a archive of old BeOS software.
 http://pulkomandy.tk/~beosarchive/

I thought it was cool because it reminded me of TORSMO for *NIX based
systems, which is quite useful.  I also thought that with some modifications SystemInfo could be even more useful and that others would like it.

I contacted the original author in July 2012 and received permission from 
him to release new versions under a permissive license.  

I am using this project as a way to learn about programming on Haiku.
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
It could set things on fire? ;)

Bugs:
- Currently, it is an App without a window which means:
	- You need close App by clicking on its DeskBar entry and selecting 
		"Quit application".
	- Can't move App by handle. Must click inside window.
- Currently the App is aways on top of other windows. 
- If a volume name is more than 6-7 characters it will overlap the statusbar.
- bugs listed by original author

ToDo:
I have no Idea if the following are possible, but it will be fun to learn.

- Rename CPU_0 -> CPU_1, etc. (Humans start counting with 1)
- Add more cpu's. max of 8 for now. 
- Add a Settings context-click menu.
- Do not have app window "Always on Top".  Allow user to select.
- Make It a proper App with window and tab with drag-able replicant handle.
- Investigate making it an app like LaunchBox with a hide-able window border.
- Move the HDD box one line down from the label it does not over-lap.
- Move the Uptime one line down from label so it does not overlap.
- Auto-detect the number of CPU's on a system instead of hard-coding 2.
	See how Activity Monitor does this.
- Auto-detect system background colour and use that instead of hard-coding.
- Auto-detect all mounted HDD.  Should still just show /boot for now.
- Embed 2x2 WorkSpace an bottom of window?
- Mouse secondary-click Context-menu?
- New Icon?
- is_computer_on_fire()?? (^_^)
