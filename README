SystemInfo for Haiku beta 0.3
	by Disreali (based on original by Brent "misza" Miszalski)

A system monitor for Haiku.

I found this app on a archive of old BeOS software and thought it was cool.
It reminded me of TORSMO for *NIX based systems, which is quite useful.
I thought that with some modifications SystemInfo could be more useful and
that others would like it also.

Bugs:
- Currently, it is Ann app without a window which means:
	- You need close App by clicking on its DeskBar entry and selecting 
		"Quit application".
	- Can't move App by handle. Must click inside window.
- Currently the App is aways on top of other windows. 
- If a volume name is more than 6-7 characters it will overlap the stausbar.
- bugs listed by original author


ToDo:
(I have no Idea if the following are possible, but it will be fun to learn.)

- Rename CPU_0 -> CPU_1, etc. (Humans start counting with 1)
- Add more cpu's. max of 8 for now. 
- Add a Settings context-click menu.
- Do not have app window "Always on Top".  Allow user to select.
- Make It a proper App with window and tab with dragable replicant handle.
- Investigate making it an app like LaunchBox with a hideable window border.
- Move the HDD box one line down from the label it does not over-lap.
- Move the Uptime one line down from label so it does not overlap.
- Auto-detect the number of CPU's on a system instead of hard-coding 2.
	See how Activity Monitor does this.
- Auto-detect system backgroud colour and use that instead of hard-coding.
- Auto-detect all mounted HDD.  Should still just show /boot for now.
- Embed 2x2 WorkSpace an bottom of window?
- Mouse secondary-click Context-menu?
- New Icon?

SystemInfo beta 2 for BeOS by Brent Miszalski (misza@ihug.com.au)

This is a little app I wrote to show some stats in a pretty way :D

It currently only shows:
-CPU 0 usage
-CPU 1 usage (this is omitted if you have 1 cpu of course)
-Memory usage
-Boot disk used space
-Uptime

Bugs
-The replicant handle (dragger) doesn't show up on the replicant after 
 restarting tracker (after disabling "Show replicants" in the deskbar. 
 PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO FIX THIS! :-) Thanks.
-You may think it's a little too fast updating the cpu usage, well it's a 
 feature! :^) This is so the ui can have that nice blurred/smooth effect.
-As always, if things behave badly, try deleting the settings file 
 (rm -rf ~/config/settings/SystemInfoReplicant) and restarting SystemInfo.

Todo
-Fix replicant bug (above)
-Add Colour prefs. (side note: a little class is included that I used in 
 digitalclock for colour prefs, it's not integrated into the app yet though)

Version History
b2.0
-SystemInfo now detects whether you have 2 cpus or not. So single cpu n00bs can
 use this app too :P
-Can now move SystemInfo around the screen by just clicking and dragging on it
-Uptime now reported correctly. (if not let me know)

b1.1
-SystemInfo is now a replicant. Put it on your desktop! :-)

b1.0
-Initial Release


Enjoy! 8^)
