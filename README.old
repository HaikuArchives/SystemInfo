SystemInfo beta 2 for BeOS by Brent Miszalski (misza@ihug.com.au)

This is a little app I wrote to show some stats in a pretty way :D

It currently only shows:
-CPU 0 usage
-CPU 1 usage (this is omitted if you have 1 cpu of course)
-Memory usage
-Boot disk used space
-Uptime

Bugs
-The replicant handle (dragger) doesn't show up on the replicant after restarting tracker (after disabling "Show replicants" in the deskbar. PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO FIX THIS! :-) Thanks.
-You may think it's a little too fast updating the cpu usage, well it's a feature! :^) This is so the ui can have that nice blurred/smooth effect.
-As always, if things behave badly, try deleting the settings file (rm -rf ~/config/settings/SystemInfoReplicant) and restarting SystemInfo.

Todo
-Fix replicant bug (above)
-Add Colour prefs. (side note: a little class is included that I used in digitalclock for colour prefs, it's not integrated into the app yet though)

-Uptime now reported correctly. (if not let me know)

b1.1
-SystemInfo is now a replicant. Put it on your desktop! :-)
