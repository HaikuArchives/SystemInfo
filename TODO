ToDo:
I have no Idea if the following are possible, but it will be fun to learn.

- Rename CPU_0 -> CPU_1, etc. (Humans start counting with 1)
- Add more cpu's. max of 8 for now. 
- Auto-detect the number of CPU's on a system instead of hard-coding 2.
	See how Activity Monitor does this.
- Do not have app window "Always on Top".
- Make It a proper App with window and tab and a drag-able replicant handle.
- Investigate making it an app like LaunchBox with a hide-able window border.
- Auto-detect all mounted HDD.  Should still just show /boot for now.
- Move the Uptime one line down from label so it does not overlap.
	or...  decrease font size. that may work also.
- Auto-detect system background colour and use that instead of hard-coding.

- Embed 2x2 WorkSpace an bottom of window?
- Add a Settings context-click menu?
- Mouse secondary-click Context-menu?
- New Icon?
- is_computer_on_fire()?? (^_^)
