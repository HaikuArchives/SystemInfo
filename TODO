(I have no Idea if the following are possible, but it will be fun to learn.)

- Rename CPU_0 -> CPU_1, etc. (most Humans start counting with 1)
- Add more cpu's. max of 8 for now.
- Auto-detect the number of CPU's on a system instead of hard-coding 2?
	See how Activity Monitor and Pulse does this.
- Add a Settings context-click menu.
- Do not have app window "Always on Top".  Allow user to select.
- Make It a proper App with window and tab with dragable replicant handle.
- Investigate making it an app like LaunchBox with a hideable window border.
- Move the HDD box one line down from the label it does not over-lap.
- Move the Uptime one line down from label so it does not overlap.
- Auto-detect system backgroud colour and use that instead of hard-coding.
- Auto-detect all mounted HDD.  Should still just show /boot for now.
- Embed 2x2 WorkSpace an bottom of window?
- Mouse secondary-click Context-menu?
- New Icon?
